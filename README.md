# Where can I find publicly available graph datasets?

I have compiled some places where you can find graph databases. It is not an extensive list but I believe that all these websites, together, represent the main places where you can find them.

- [Network repository](http://networkrepository.com/): It has thousands of graph databases from several different domains. It is also an interactive repository, so you can vosualize and explore graphs.
- [Big Graph Analytics](http://lgylym.github.io/big-graph/): Lists datasets and platforms available to work with graphs, including Stanfords collection (SNAP). It focuses on 'big' graph datasets.
- [Awesome-Graph](https://github.com/jbmusso/awesome-graph): Lists many graph databases and tools and frameworks used to work with graphs
- [The Graphs Blog](https://thegraphsblog.wordpress.com/datasets/): Provides a list where you can find real and synthetic graph datasets.
- [SocioPatterns](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/): They collected data through their platform and made them available to the public. Besides the data, you can also find link to their analysis and results they had published.
